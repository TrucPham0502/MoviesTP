# Application
I utilized Swift with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and incorporated RxSwift and RxCocoa to manage asynchronous data streams and improve the overall performance of the application. The app made API calls to a backend server written in Node.js to clone data from a movie website, and the backend server used Redis to store and manage the data.
